## 🔥 Latest Updates : 

### January 27th 2026: WanGP v10.54, Music for your Hearts

WanGP Special *TTS* (Text To Speech) Release:

- **Heart Mula**: *Suno* quality song with lyrics on your local PC. You can generate up to 4 min of music.

- **Qwen 3 TTS**: you can either do *Voice Cloning*, *Generate a Custom Voice based on a Prompt* or use a *Predefined Voice*

- **TTS Features**:
   - **Early stop** : you can abort a gen, while still keeping what has been generated (will work only for TTS models which are *Autoregressive Models*, no need to ask that for Image/Video gens which are *Diffusion Models*)
   - **Specialized Prompt Enhancers**: if you enter the prompt in Heart Mula *"a song about AI generation"*, *WanGP Prompt Enhancer* will generate the corresponding masterpiece for you. Likewise you can enhance "A speech about AI generation" when using Qwen3 TTS or ChatterBox.
   - **Custom Output folder for Audio Gens**: you can now choose a different folder for the *Audio Outputs*
   - **Default Memory Profile for Audio Models**: TTS models can get very slow if you use profile 4 (being autoregressive models, they will need to load all the layers one per one to generate one single audio token then rinse & repeat). On the other hand, they dont't need as much VRAM, so you can now define a more agressive profile (3+ for instance)

- **Z Image Base**: try it if you are into the *Z Image* hype but it will be probably useless for you unless you are a researcher and / or want to build a finetune out of it. This model requires from 35 to 50 steps (4x to 6x slower than *Z Image turbo*) and cfg > 1 (an additional 2x slower) and there is no *Reinforcement Learning* so Output Images wont be as good. The plus side is a higher diversity and *Native Negative Prompt* (versus Z Image virtual Negative Prompt using *NAG*) 

- **Various Improvements**:
   - Video /Audio Galleries now support deletions of gens done outside WanGP
   - added *MP3 support* for audio outputs
   - *Check for Updates* button for *Plugins* to see in a glance if any of your plugin can be updated
   - *Prompt Enhancer* generates a different enhanced prompt each timee you click on it. You can define in the config tab its gen parameters (top k, temperature)
   - New *Root Loras* folder can be defined in the config Tab. Useful if you have multiple WanGP instances or want to store easily all your loras in a different hard drive 

*update 10.51*: new Heart Mula Finetune better at following instructions, Extra settings (cfg, top k) for TTS models, Rife v4\
*update 10.52*: updated plugin list and added version tracking\
*update 10.53*: video/audio galleries now support deletions\
*update 10.54*: added Z Image Omnibase, prompt enhancers improvements, configurable loras root folder

### January 20th 2026: WanGP v10.43, The Cost Saver
*GPUs are expensive, RAM is expensive, SSD are expensive, sadly we live now in a GPU & RAM poor.*

WanGP comes again to the rescue:

- **GGUF support**: as some of you know, I am not a big fan of this format because when used with image / video generative models we don't get any speed boost (matrices multiplications are still done at 16 bits), VRAM savings are small and quality is worse than with int8/fp8. Still gguf has one advantage: it consumes less RAM and harddrive space. So enjoy gguf support. I have added ready to use *Kijai gguf finetunes* for *LTX 2*.

- **Models Manager PlugIn**: use this *Plugin* to identify how much space is taken by each *model* / *finetune* and delete the ones you no longer use. Try to avoid deleting shared files otherwise they will be downloaded again.  

- **LTX 2 Dual Video & Audio Control**: you no longer need to extract the audio track of a *Control Video* if you want to use it as well to drive the video generation. New mode will allow you to use both motion and audio from Video Control.

- **LTX 2 - Custom VAE URL**: some users have asked if they could use the old *Distiller VAE* instead of the new one. To do that, create a *finetune* def based on an existing model definition and save it in the *finetunes/* folder with this entry (check the *docs/FINETUNES.md* doc):
```
		"VAE_URLs": ["https://huggingface.co/DeepBeepMeep/LTX-2/resolve/main/ltx-2-19b_vae_old.safetensors"]
```

- **Flux 2 Klein 4B & 9B**: try these distilled models as fast as Z_Image if not faster but with out of the box image edition capabiltities

- **Flux 2 & Qwen Outpainting + Lanpaint**: the inpaint mode of these models support now *outpainting* + more combination possible with *Lanpaint* 

- **RAM Optimizations for multi minutes Videos**: processing, saving, spatial & Temporal upsampling very long videos should require much less RAM. 

- **Text Encoder Cache**: if you are asking a Text prompt already used recently with the current model, it will be taken straight from a cache. The cache is optimized to consume little RAM. It wont work with certain models such as Qwen where the Text Prompt is combined internally with an Image.

*update 10.41*: added Flux 2 klein\
*update 10.42*: added RAM optimizations & Text Encoder Cache\
*update 10.43*: added outpainting for Qwen & Flux 2, Lanpaint for Flux 2

### January 15th 2026: WanGP v10.30, The Need for Speed ...

- **LTX Distilled VAE Upgrade**: *Kijai* has observed that the Distilled VAE produces images that were less sharp that the VAE of the Non Distilled model. I have used this as an opportunity to repackage all the LTX 2 checkpoints and reduce their overal HD footprint since they all share around 5GB. 

**So dont be surprised if the old checkpoints are deleted and new are downloaded !!!**.

- **LTX2 Multi Passes Loras multipliers**: *LTX2* supports now loras multiplier that depend on the Pass No. For instance "1;0.5" means 1 will the strength for the first LTX2 pass and 0.5 will be the strength for the second pass.

- **New Profile 3.5**: here is the lost kid of *Profile 3* & *Profile 5*, you got tons of VRAM, but little RAM ? Profile 3.5 will be your new friend as it will no longer use Reserved RAM to accelerate transfers. Use Profile 3.5 only if you can fit entirely a *Diffusion / Transformer* model in VRAM, otherwise the gen may be much slower.

- **NVFP4 Quantization for LTX 2 & Flux 2**: you will now be able to load *NV FP4* model checkpoints in WanGP. On top of *Wan NV4* which was added recently, we now have *LTX 2 (non distilled)* & *Flux 2* support. NV FP4 uses slightly less VRAM and up to 30% less RAM. 

To enjoy fully the NV FP4 checkpoints (**at least 30% faster gens**), you will need a RTX 50xx and to upgrade to *Pytorch 2.9.1 / Cuda 13* with the latest version of *lightx2v kernels* (check *docs/INSTALLATION.md*). To observe the speed gain, you have to make sure the workload is quite high (high res, long video).


### January 13th 2026: WanGP v10.24, When there is no VRAM left there is still some VRAM left ...

- **LTX 2 - SUPER VRAM OPTIMIZATIONS**  

*With WanGP 10.21 HD 720p Video Gens of 10s just need now 8GB of VRAM!*

LTX Team said this video gen was for 4k. So I had no choice but to squeeze more VRAM with further optimizations.

After much suffering I have managed to reduce by at least 1/3 the VRAM requirements of LTX 2, which means:
  - 10s at 720p can be done with only 8GB of VRAM
  - 10s at 1080p with only 12 GB of VRAM
  - 20s at 1080p with only 16 GB of VRAM
  - 10s at Full 4k (3840 x 2176 !!!) with 24 GB of VRAM.  However the bad news is LTX 2 video is not for 4K, as 4K outputs may give you nightmares ...

3K/4K resolutions will be available only if you enable them in the *Config* / *General* tab.

- **Ic Loras support**: Use a *Control Video* to transfer *Pose*, *Depth*, *Canny Edges*. I have added some extra tweaks: with WanGP you can restrict the transfer to a *masked area*, define a *denoising strength* (how much the control video is going to be followed) and a *masking strength* (how much unmasked area is impacted) 

- **Start Image Strength**: This new slider will appear below a *Start Image* or Source *Video*. If you set it to values lower than 1 you may to reduce the static image effect, you get sometime with LTX2 i2v
 
- **Custom Gemma Text Encoder for LTX 2**: As a practical case, the *Heretic* text encoder is now supported by WanGP. Check the *finetune* doc, but in short create a *finetune* that has a *text_encoder_URLS* key that contains a list of one or more file paths or URLs.  

- **Experimental Auto Recovery Failed Lora Pin**: Some users (with usually PC with less than 64 GB of RAM) have reported Out Of Memory although a model seemed to load just fine when starting a gen with Loras. This is sometime related to WanGP attempting (and failing due to unsufficient reserved RAM) to pin the Loras to Reserved Memory for faster gen. I have experimented a recovery mode that should release sufficient ressources to continue the Video Gen. This may solve the oom crashes with *LTX2 Default (non distilled)* 

- **Max Loras Pinned Slider**:  If the Auto Recovery Mode is still not sufficient, I have added a Slider at the bottom of the  *Configuration*  / *Performance* tab that you can use to prevent WanGP from Pinning Loras (to do so set it to 0). As if there is no loading attempt there wont be any crash...

*update 10.21*: added slider Loras Max Pinning slider\
*update 10.22*: added support for custom Ltx2 Text Encoder + Auto Recovery mode if Lora Pinning failed\
*update 10.23*: Fixed text prompt ignore in profile 1 & 2 (this created random output videos)

### January 9st 2026: WanGP v10.11, Spoiled again

- **LTX 2**: here is the long awaited *Ovi Challenger*, LTX-2 generates video and an audio soundtrack. As usual this WanGP version is *low VRAM*. You should be able to run it with as low as 10 GB of VRAM. If you have at least 24 GB of VRAM you will be able to generate 20s at 720p in a single window in only 2 minutes with the distilled model.  WanGP LTX 2 version supports on day one, *Start/End keyframes*, *Sliding-Window* / *Video Continuation* and *Generation Preview*. A *LTX 2 distilled* is part of the package for a very fast generation.

With WanGP v10.11 you can now force your soundtrack, it works like *Multitalk* / *Avatar* except in theory it should work with any kind of sound (not just vocals). Thanks to *Kijai* for showing it was possible.

- **Z Image Twin Folder Turbo**: Z Image even faster as this variant can generate images with as little as 1 step (3 steps recommend) 

- **Qwen LanPaint**: very precise *In Painting*, offers a better integration of the inpainted area in the rest of the image. Beware it is up to 5x slower as it "searches" for the best replacement. 

- **Optimized Pytorch Compiler** : *Patience is the Mother of Virtue*. Finally I may (or may not) have fixed the PyTorch compiler with the Wan models. It should work in much diverse situations and takes much less time. 

- **LongCat Video**: experimental support which includes *LongCat Avatar* a talking head model. For the moment it is mostly for models collectors as it is very slow. It needs 40+ steps and each step contains up 3 passes.

- **MMaudio NSFW**: for alternative audio background

*update v10.11*: LTX 2, use your own soundtrack




See full changelog: **[Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md)**


## 🚀 Quick Start

**One-click installation:** 
Get started instantly with [Pinokio App](https://pinokio.computer/)\
It is recommended to use in Pinokio the Community Scripts *wan2gp* or *wan2gp-amd* by **Morpheus** rather than the official Pinokio install.


**Manual installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP.git
cd Wan2GP
conda create -n wan2gp python=3.10.9
conda activate wan2gp
pip install torch==2.7.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu128
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the application:**
```bash
python wgp.py
```

First time using WanGP ? Just check the *Guides* tab, and you will find a selection of recommended models to use.

**Update the application:**
If using Pinokio use Pinokio to update otherwise:
Get in the directory where WanGP is installed and:
```bash
git pull
conda activate wan2gp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

if you get some error messages related to git, you may try the following (beware this will overwrite local changes made to the source code of WanGP):
```bash
git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/main
conda activate wan2gp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run headless (batch processing):**

Process saved queues without launching the web UI:
```bash
# Process a saved queue
python wgp.py --process my_queue.zip
